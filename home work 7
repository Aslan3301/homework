White queen (ферзь) will stand in space a1 = 1 / 8 
Black queen will stand in space a1 = 0
White rook (ладья) will stand in space a1 = 1 / 4
White queen will not stand in space a1 = 7 / 8
White rook will not stand in space a1 = 3 / 4 
There is a white queen in space a1. Find a probability that:
King in a2 = 1 / 7
Knight (конь) in a2 = 1 / 7
Knight in a1 = 0
