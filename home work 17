1. Function - in mathematics, the correspondence between the elements of two sets,
established according to such a rule that each element of the first set corresponds to one and only one element of the second set.
A derivative is a financial security with a value that is reliant upon or derived from, an underlying asset or group of assetsâ€”a benchmark.
The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties, and the derivative derives its price from fluctuations in the underlying asset.
If sign of the derivative positive our function is increasing, if the sign of the derivative negative our function is decreasing. 
The derivitive is dx / dy 
2. The global minimum is -1.181903499840038. I find it with help this code :
import random
#args:
# f - function to find a derivitive
# x1 - x1 is coord
def derivitive(f, x1):
    dx = 0.000001
    x2 = x1 + dx
    y1 = f(x1)
    y2 = f(x2)
    dy = y2 - y1
    return dy / dx

f = lambda x: x ** 4 + x ** 3 - x ** 2

def find_min(f, learning_rate = 0.001, itter_count = 1000, currentX = None):
    steps = 0
    if currentX is None:
        currentX = random.randint(-10, 10)
    for i in range(itter_count):
        der = derivitive(f, currentX)
        currentX -= learning_rate * der
        if -0.05 < der < 0.05:
            return print(currentX), print(steps)
        print(currentX)
        steps += 1
    print(currentX)
    print(steps)
find_min(f)
3. Learning rate is the paramitar of step usually it is very small namber.
If our derivitive is 0 it is minimum or max of function and if our y is smallest and derivitive is 0 it is minimum 
4. Our function is not get the true value becouse we can onle predict it. And the difference of our prediction and true value is our error.
Y_pred is our prediction, Y_true is our true value. df / da  is derivitive of a(koef), Df / dx is derivitive of x(variable).
